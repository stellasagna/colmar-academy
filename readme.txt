To the graders---

I had limited time during this project due to unforeseen circumstances, but I believe I utilized my knowledge of CSS close enough to the best of my current abilities to be able to submit this project with confidence. I wish I had more time to make some tweaks, but I am already past the due date, and I am aware the date for the end of the entire program is upcoming. 

Anyway, I enjoyed this project and course, and I have already made the next steps into utilizing the things I've learned to advance my professional and personal video game-related goals.

Best regards,
